# NYU CUSP | Data Visualization Final Challenge
#### Analyzing ride-hailing services in Manhattan area. 

We would like to understand the impact of ride-pooling, particularly if all rides are meant to be shared. We will verify and study some scenarios/tasks we chose in this challenge. 

# Scenarios 
### 2. For those trips that could not be served, do they follow a spatial or temporal pattern? For example, are most of those trips originated in particular regions, and of certain times?

### 4. We also limit vehicle capacity to at most 4 passengers. Were there vehicles violating this condition? If so, can you show any pattern about these vehicles? For example, how many of them were violating, and where were they distributed in both time and space?

### 5. What can we learn about the vehicle utilization? Are most of them empty, or with 1, 2, 3 or 4 passengers? Are there particular vehicles that tend to ride with more passengers than others? If so, how are they distributed in space and time.

### 8. If we are to pick a particular vehicle ID, how can we effectively illustrate its activities throughout the day?
